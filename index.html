                <h3>Collection management services</h3>
                <p>This project came from the Special Collections department of the BYU Library. They have a service
                    where they provide materials to use along with the special collection items. An employee always had
                    to be at the desk if someone came to make a request or return because their system was paper-based.
                    I was able to design a web-based system for them so that they could streamline and simplify the
                    material request/return process and allow people to initiate a request/return remotely.</p>
                <p>There wasn't a style guide or design system I needed to follow for this project. I knew that upfront,
                    so I was able to start the research/brainstorming process knowing that I had some <em>design
                        freedom.</em></p>

                <h3>Saved items</h3>
                <p>The My Account section of the BYU Library website had recently been redesigned, but the Bookmarks
                    page within My Account had not been updated as part of the redesign. I was asked to make the
                    Bookmarks page match the rest of the new My Account interface while also finding ways to improve the
                    Bookmarks system.</p>

                <h3>Site redesign: Navigation and icons</h3>
                <p>For quite some time, my supervisors had been talking with the BYU Library administration about
                    redesigning the Library website. As a team, we started thinking about a redesign and how it would
                    work logistically. We decided to start researching and brainstorming, even though the actual
                    redesign wouldn't be happening immediately. I was tasked with creating a new navigation style for
                    the redesign.</p>
